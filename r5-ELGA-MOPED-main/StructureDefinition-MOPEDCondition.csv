The evidence may be a simple list of coded symptoms/manifestations, or references to observations or formal assessments, or both.  For example, if the Condition.code is pneumonia, then there could be an evidence list where Condition.evidence.concept = fever (CodeableConcept), Condition.evidence.concept = cough (CodeableConcept), and Condition.evidence.reference = bronchitis (reference to Condition).","","","","","","","","",,"example","","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/clinical-findings","",,,,"Condition.evidence",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
