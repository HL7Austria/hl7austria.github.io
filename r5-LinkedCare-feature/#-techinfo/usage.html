                User Susanne Allzeit (DGKP) is an employee at the mobile caregiver organization Pflegedienst Immerdar, 
                whose client, Renate Rüssel-Olifant, is not in the LINCA system yet. 
                Hence, Susanne Allzeit creates a client record in the system.
                Now, it is possible to order prescriptions for Renate Rüssel-Olifant. 
                As Susanne Allzeit will pick up the medication on the go, she places the order 
                without specifying a pharmacy.

                <h4>Re-stock order for existing client</h4>
                User Susanne Allzeit (DGKP) is an employee at the mobile caregiver 
                organization Pflegedienst Immerdar, whose client, Renate Rüssel-Olifant, is 
                already registered as patient in the LINCA system. 
                Susanne Allzeit needs to re-stock prescription medication for Renate Rüssel-Olifant. 
                Hence, she places an order on LINCA referring to the existing patient 
                record of Renate Rüssel-Olifant. 
                Additionally, she specifies her preferred pharmacy, Apotheke 'Klappernder Storch', in advance 
                to collect the order there. 
            </p>

                <h4>Inpatient care facility order</h4>
                User Walter Specht (DGKP) is a caregiver in the inpatient care facility Haus Vogelsang. 
                He needs to collectively order prescription medication for several clients, amongst others 
                for Günter Gürtelthier and Patrizia Platypus. Patrizia's practitioner is 
                Dr. Kunibert Kreuzotter, Günter's practitioner is Dr. Silvia Spitzmaus. 
                Walter Specht places an order for all needed client prescription medication on LINCA 
                and specifies in advance the pharmacy Apotheke 'Zum frühen Vogel' that ought 
                to prepare the order
                </p>
            <p>
                <h4> Modifying an order </h4>
                User Walter Specht (DGKP) is a caregiver in the inpatient care facility Haus Vogelsang. 
                He has already placed a collective order for prescription medication for several clients on LINCA.
                Now, he needs to modify details of that order, in particular he wants to update one 
                individual order position for his client Günter Gürtelthier.
                The LINCA systems prevents Walter Specht from updating such a position 
                if Günter's practitioner, Dr. Silvia Spitzmaus, has already issued a prescription for that order position
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4> Cancel an individual order positions </h4>
                User Walter Specht (DGKP) is a caregiver in the inpatient care facility Haus Vogelsang. 
                He has already placed a collective order for prescription medication for several clients on LINCA.
                Now, he needs to cancel individual order positions for his client Patrizia Platypus.
                He submits updates on those positions, providing a reason for cancellation, such as a medical reason, 
                and sets their status to 'cancelled'. 
                The LINCA systems prevents Walter Specht from submitting such cancellations
                if Patrizia's practitioner, Dr. Kunibert Kreuzotter, has already issued a prescription for the original order position
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4> Cancel a complete order </h4>
                User Walter Specht (DGKP) is a caregiver in the inpatient care facility Haus Vogelsang. 
                He has already placed a collective order for prescription medication for several clients on LINCA. Now, he needs to cancel the complete order due to a major mistake.
                He submits a delete request on the order number, providing a reason for cancellation, such as a human error. 
                Then, either the whole order will be cancelled by the LINCA system, if for none of its positions the designated practitioner has already issued a prescription and the status is set to 'revoked' by LINCA, or the whole order will remain active if for any of its positions the designated practitioner has already issued a prescription. And positions for which the designated practitioner has not yet issued a prescription,  will be promoted to the status 'cancelled' by the LINCA system
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4> Check order status </h4>
                User Walter Specht (DGKP) is a caregiver in the inpatient care facility Haus Vogelsang. 
                He has already placed a collective order for prescription medication for several clients on LINCA.
                Walter Specht needs to know the status of that order, and he has the permission to read the 
                entire order. 
                Hence, he submits a read request on the order number, and his care software can use the returned LINCA order position chains, and visually present the status of the order and all its positions.

                <h4> Retrieve open orders </h4>
                 Practitioner Dr. Kunibert Kreuzotter is responsible for the LINCA registered care giver clients Patrizia Platypus and Renate Rüssel-Olifant, who are two of his patients. 
                Dr. Kunibert Kreuzotter has access to and permission in a practitioner role in the LINCA system, 
                hence he is expected to prescribe orders via the LINCA system. 
                When he submits a read request to the LINCA system he gets all open orders where he is mentioned as the designated practitioner, 
                e.g., all open orders for Patrizia Platypus and Renate Rüssel-Olifant.
                Dr. Kreuzotters software can interpret the returned LINCA order position chains

                <h4> Stop medication intake </h4>
                 Practitioner Dr. Silvia Spitzmaus is responsible for the LINCA registered care giver client Günter Gürtelthier. 
                She has received a LINCA order position requesting medication prescription for him.
                She decides that Günter Gürtelthier shall no longer take the medication intended by that order position. 
                Hence, she submits an update on that order position with the status set to 'stopped' or 'ended', and her software will send that to the LINCA server, and the ordering care giver organization Haus Vogelsang will be informed that this position will not be prescribed further on.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4> Prescribe as ordered </h4>
                Practitioner Dr. Silvia Spitzmaus is responsible for the LINCA registered care giver client Günter Gürtelthier. 
                She has received a LINCA order position requesting medication prescription for him.
                She decides to issue a prescription for the medication for Günter Gürtelthier intended by that order position. 
                Hence, she submits a prescription for that position with the eMedId and eRezeptId she got
                and her software will send that to the LINCA server,
                and the ordering care giver organization Haus Vogelsang will be informed that the order position has been prescribed as ordered.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Prescribe with medication adaptions</h4>
                Practitioner Dr. Silvia Spitzmaus is responsible for the LINCA registered care giver client Günter Gürtelthier. 
                She has received a LINCA order position requesting medication prescription for him.
                She decides that the medication intended by a particular order position needs to be adjusted.  
                Hence, she submits a prescription for that position with the eMedId and eRezeptId she got, with changed medication/quantity,
                and her software will send that to the LINCA server,
                and the ordering care giver organization Haus Vogelsang will be informed that the order position has been 
                prescribed with modified medication/quantity
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Prescribe with dosage adaptions</h4>
                Practitioner Dr. Silvia Spitzmaus is responsible for the LINCA registered care giver client Günter Gürtelthier. She has received a LINCA order position requesting medication prescription for him and has already 
                submitted a prescription for that order position.
                She decides that the dosage instructions in the prior prescription need to be defined or modified. 
                Hence, she submits an update to that prescription with new dosage instructions,
                and her software will send that to the LINCA server, and the ordering care giver organization Haus Vogelsang will be informed that the prescription has been updated with altered dosage

                <h4>Prescribe supplementary article</h4>
                Practitioner Dr. Silvia Spitzmaus is responsible for the LINCA registered care giver client Günter Gürtelthier. 
                She has received a LINCA order position requesting medication prescription for him.
                She decides that  an additional medication is needed for Günter Gürtelthier.
                Hence, she creates and submits an additionally prescribed position referring to the LINCA order number and her software will send that to the LINCA server,and the ordering care giver organization Haus Vogelsang will be informed that the order has been extended with an additional position,
                and that does not change anything about the fact that Dr. Spitzmaus cannot read other positions of that same order where she is not the designated practitioner
