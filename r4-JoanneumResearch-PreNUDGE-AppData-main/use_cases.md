## Use Cases

The transmission of health profile data from the qualified apps to the **PräNUDGE platform** is optional. Health profile data will only be sent once citizens establish the connection within the app and give their **consent**.
 After successful app pairing, the mobile application communicates with the PräNUDGE platform via standard **FHIR RESTful interactions** that must comply with this **Implementation Guide (IG)**.

### Process of App Pairing initiated by the citizen from within the app

This sequence describes the process of a citizen connecting their mobile application to the **PreNUDGE platform** using **ID-Austria** for identity verification and authorization.

1. **Privacy Information**: The citizen reviews the data processing terms, transfer protocols, and the platform's privacy policy.
1. **Initiation**: The citizen starts the "App Pairing" process within the app.
1. **Authorization Request**: The app initiates an**OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow**by redirecting to the**PreNUDGE IAM**.
1. **Authentication**: The citizen authenticates via**ID-Austria**.
1. **Identity Exchange**: ID-Austria provides verified user information (e.g.,`gh:bpk`,`ssn`) to the PreNUDGE IAM, which then persists the user identity.
1. **Consent Management**: The citizen provides explicit consent for both the platform usage and the specific app pairing.
1. **Token Issuance**: Upon successful consent, the PreNUDGE IAM issues a**token set**to the app, containing a**pairwise subject identifier**.
1. **Profile Integration**: The app stores the token set within the local user profile. The**pairwise subject identifier**is used as the**FHIR Patient ID**to reference all subsequent clinical resources (e.g.,`Observation`,`QuestionnaireResponse`, etc.).

### FHIR Communication

After the app pairing is successfully completed, the mobile application can communicate with the **PreNUDGE platform** through standard **FHIR RESTful interactions**.
 Using the obtained access token, the app can perform authorized operations such as:

* **GET** requests to retrieve patient-related resources (e.g., `GET /Patient/{id}`, `GET /Observation?patient={id}`)
* **POST** requests to submit new data like observations or questionnaire responses
* **PUT** requests to update existing resources

All interactions **MUST** conform to the specifications, resource profiles, and security guidelines defined in this **Implementation Guide (IG)** to ensure compliance, interoperability, and data integrity.
 These interactions follow the [HL7® FHIR R4 REST API](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html) principles, ensuring full interoperability and secure data exchange between the citizen's app and the platform.
